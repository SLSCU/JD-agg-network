This work presents a novel framework for learning job title representations by using job description (B), bypassing the traditional dependence on skill extraction (A).

## Dataset details
The [mycareersfuture.sg](https://github.com/WING-NUS/JD2Skills-BERT-XMLC/tree/main) is used as a training dataset. We concatenate the fields "Role & Responsibilities" and "Job Requriement" to represent the job description.

The evaluation dataset is taken from [ESCO-Job Normalization](https://github.com/jensjorisdecorte/JobBERT-evaluation-dataset) where the goal is to predict the standized version of each job title. Following the original paper, we measure micro-average R@5,R@10 and MRR.

To do so, existing methods primarily rely on learning the title representation through skills extracted from the job description, neglecting the rich and diverse content within. Thus, we propose an alternative framework for learning job titles through their respective job description (JD) and utilize a Job Description Aggregator component to handle the lengthy description and bidirectional contrastive loss to account for the bidirectional relationship between the job title and its description. We evaluated the performance of our method on both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, achieving a superior performance over the skill-based approach.",
